# Simple-XOR

This program is developed in the QT Creator environment using the MINGW compiler.
The program allows you to perform an XOR operation on selected files.

The program allows you to:
1. Select the input directory and set the mask to search for files.
2. Specify the output directory (if nothing is specified, the input directory will be used for saving)
3. Specify whether to delete the file after XOR. If it was used with the "Overwrite" marker, the file will disappear.
4. Choose to overwrite the output file or create a new copy where the result will be saved.
5. Adjust the timer operation so that XOR occurs automatically.
6. Set a constant for the XOR operation.
